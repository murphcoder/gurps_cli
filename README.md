# GurpsCli

The GURPS CLI gem allows the user to browse through the catalog of books for the roleplaying game GURPS in a text based interface.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gurps_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gurps_cli

## Usage

To use this gem as part of an application, simply execute 'Browser.New' in your code. Alternatively, if you would like to inherit the gem's methods into another class, you may do that by inheriting the module 'GurpsCli'.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
